        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Oyakodon is a traditional Japanese dish that translates to "parent-and-child donburi." 
            It is a type of donburi, which is a rice bowl dish, and is known for its comforting and savory flavors. 
            The name "parent-and-child" refers to the use of both chicken (the parent) and egg (the child) in the dish.

            Cooking Oyakodon is remarkably easy, making it a perfect choice for a quick and delicious homemade meal. 
            The preparation involves simple steps: simmering the chicken and onions in a flavorful broth made from 
            dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar, then adding beaten eggs and cooking them until just set. The entire process can be completed in one pan, minimizing cleanup.
